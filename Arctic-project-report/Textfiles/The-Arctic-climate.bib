  abstract = {The International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) grid model has been used to define the first-order physiographic provinces of the Arctic Ocean, which in this study is taken to consist of the oceanic deep Arctic Ocean Basin; the broad continental shelves of the Barents, Kara, Laptev, East Siberian, and Chukchi Seas; the White Sea; and the narrow continental shelves of the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic continental margins of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland. The first step in this classification is an evaluation of seafloor gradients contained in a slope model that was derived from the IBCAO grid. The evaluation of this slope model, which emphasizes certain process-related seafloor features that are reflected in the bathymetric information, is subsequently used along with the bathymetry to classify the first-order physiographic provinces. The areas of the provinces so classified are individually calculated, and their morphologies are subsequently discussed in the context of the geologic evolution of the Arctic Ocean Basin as described in the published literature. In summary, this study provides a physiographic classification of the Arctic Ocean seafloor according to the most up-to-date bathymetric model, addresses the geologic origin of the prominent features, and provides area computations of the defined first-order physiographic provinces and of the most prominent second- order features.},

  abstract = {"This second edition brings this definitive book completely up to date with the many advances in our understanding of Arctic climate since the first edition was published in 2005. The book has also been extensively reorganized to weave issues of Arctic change throughout the text, rather than confining them to a single chapter. It is the first to provide an integrated assessment of the Arctic climate system, recognizing that a true understanding of how the Arctic functions lies in appreciating the interactions and linkages among its various components. The book begins with a historical perspective, followed by discussion of the basic physical and climatic characteristics of the Arctic. Following a review of past climates (paleoclimates), the book closes with an assessment of the Arctic's uncertain future. Though targeted mainly at advanced students and researchers, this book is accessible to anyone with an interest in the Arctic and a basic understanding of climate science"--},
