\section{Introduction}
The Arctic and the Antarctic are two unique regions on Earth that are characterized by extreme cold temperatures, vast ice sheets, and unique ecosystems. The Arctic is located in the northern hemisphere and is centred around the North Pole.

\subsection{Background}
When dealing with the Arctic, it is important to define the region. The Arctic is commonly defined as the area north of the Arctic Circle, which is located at approximately 66\degr33'' N latitude \citep{ArcticWeatherClimate,serrezeArcticClimateSystem2014}. However, others define the Arctic based on the extent of the Arctic ecosystem, which requires a July mean temperature under 10 \(^\circ C\) \citep{ArcticWeatherClimate}. Using this definition, the Arctic can be divided into two main sub-regions, including the Arctic maritime region and the Arctic continental region according to \citet{ArcticWeatherClimate}. 

The Arctic maritime region includes the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding seas such as the Bering and Greenland Seas, as well as the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay. This region is sometimes described as a mediterranean type ocean due to its limited connection to the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean \citep{Danilov2000}. Looking at the bathymetry of the Arctic ocean one can observe that the Bering strait, but also the Canadian archipelago and the Barents sea, is shallow with a depth of hundreds of meters. Comparing this with the Fram strait between Svalbard and Greenland it is much deeper, allowing a bottleneck water flow between the Arctic and the Atlantic \citep{jakobssonPhysiographicProvincesArctic2003}. Thus it is very reasonable to view this ocean as a semi isolated ocean, just like the mediterranean. 

The Arctic continental region consists of the places like Svalbard, northern Canada, Russia and the Nordic Countries. However the main landmass is Greenland, covering an area of
